Technique project - from whitepaper https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/papers/infovis14-onset.pdf

To run:
---
Local: Use an http server to serve the `/src` dir. Then browse to the server host and port as usual (perhaps something like `localhost:8000`) which will serve `index.html`. NOTE: opening up `index.html` directly in most browsers won't work because of CORS errors (opening in Firefox usually works though)


Deployed: Alternatively, just go to https://d3viz.netlify.com/ (if it doesn't load the first time and there are no console errors, try refreshing page)
